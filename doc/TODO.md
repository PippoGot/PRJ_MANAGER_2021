3 - upgrade the node and the node editor to have more features and widgets
the editor will have widgets for all the fields of the node
upgrade the node structure to be composed with different type of data
for example the idea of RootNode, HardwareNode etc...

4 - add a label to define the level of a node (now a component)
create a standalone class for the ID number (examples #000-001, #MEH-001 etc...)
